# Causal-dominance
How to evaluate causal dominance in lagged effects models

# R code to run a `wave-specific' parameters model
# We display the R code for applying the GORICA to a bivariate wave-specific parameters RI-CLPM, like Masselink et al.(2018) use. 
# That is, we allow for the standardized autoregressive parameters and the standardized cross-lagged parameters to change over time. 


# Step 0: Install the packages in R by executing the following:

install.packages("lavaan")
install.packages("restriktor")
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("rebeccakuiper/ICweights")

# Then, load the packages as follow:

library(lavaan)  	
library(restriktor) 
library(devtools)
library(ICweights) 	 

# Step 1: Load the data set into R, where we assume that data set is called `data.dat'.

data <- read.table("data.dat")

# Note that we do not need to standardize data now (i.e., Step 2 of Appendix A is not needed here) since the parameters are allowed to change over time.

# Step 2: Specify the causal dominance hypothesis of interest,

H1b <- "abs(beta2) < abs(gamma2); abs(beta3) < abs(gamma3)". 

# Label all of the standardized cross-lagged effects when fitting the data with RI-CLPM in lavaan} package. 
# Since the standardized effects are allow to change over time, so use time-specific names (as in Figure 2), 
# where `beta2' and `gamma2' are the standardized cross-lagged effects between the variables at time point 1 and time point 2, 
# and `beta3' and `gamma3' are the standardized cross-lagged effects between the variables at time point 2 and time point 3.

# Step 3: Fit the RI-CLPM using the R package lavaan.

riclpm2 <- lavaan(riclpmModel2, data = data,

int.lv.free = F,
auto.fix.first = F,
auto.fix.single = F,
auto.cov.lv.x = F,
auto.cov.y = F,
auto.var = F)

# Step 4: Standardize parameter estimates for a fair comparison of parameters, one often needs the corresponding variables to be measured 
# on the same scale. To make parameters comparable, it is often helpful (like in case of cross-lagged parameters referring to variables on different scales)
# to inspect standardized parameters.

StdEst <- standardizedsolution(riclpm2, type = "std.nox", 
          se = TRUE, zstat = TRUE, pvalue = TRUE, 
          ci = TRUE, level = 0.95, cov.std = TRUE, 
          remove.eq = TRUE, remove.ineq = TRUE, 
          remove.def = FALSE, partable = NULL, 
          GLIST = NULL, est = NULL)

# To obtain standardized estimates, we use the standardizedsolution() function in the lavaan package with `std.nox' as the type of standardization; 
# in this type of standardization, the standardized estimates are based on both the variances of both (continuous) observed and latent variables, 
# but not the variances of exogenous covariates.

# Step 5: Extract the standardized cross-lagged estimates and their covariance matrix.

est2  <- StdEst[c(25,29,23,27),5]
names(est2) <- c("beta2", "gamma2", "beta3", "gamma3")

vcov2 <- lavInspect(riclpm2, "vcov.std.nox")[c(13,17,11,15), c(13,17,11,15)]


# By using the argument `vcov.std.nox', one obtains the variance covariance matrix of
# the standardized estimated model parameters, where standardization is done with respect to both observed
# and latent variables (and not the exogenous observed covariates). Note that, we cannot use the lavaan object like in Step 5 
# in R code to run a `wave-independent' parameters model now, because then the unstandardized estimates will be used.

# Step 6: Compute the GORICA values and weights using the goric() function from the restriktor package.

goricaResult2 <- goric(est2, VCOV = vcov2, H1b, comparison = "complement", type = "gorica")

# Below are the results for H1b compared with its complement.

# restriktor (0.2-800): generalized order-restriced
# information criterion approximation:

# Results:
# model       loglik  penalty  gorica  gorica.weights
# H1b         8.410    2.977  -10.865          0.586
# complement  8.607    3.523  -10.168          0.414

# ---

# The log likelihood value of the complement of H1b is higher than that of H1b, indicating that the estimates are not in agreement with H1b. 
# However, the log likelihood values do seem to be close. Additionally, the GORICA weights show that H1b has 0.586/0.414 = 1.415 times more support than 
# its complement. Hence, there is some support for the hypothesis which states that the cross-lagged effect of self-esteem on the depressive symptoms 
# is stonger (in absolute sense) than the cross-lagged effect of depressive symptoms on the self-esteem. Nevertheless, the support for H1b versus 
# its complement does not seem to be overwhelming. Thus, there is some evidence for H1b being the best hypothesis, but there is no compelling evidence.

# Step 7: Compute the penalty weights using the IC.weights() function from the ICweights package.

GORICA_weights2 <- goricaResult2$result[,5]
Penalty_weights2 <- IC.weights(2*goricaResult2$result[,3])$IC.weights

# Below, are the GORICA weights and the penalty weights for $H_{1b}$ and its complement.

# > GORICA_weights2
# [1] 0.586   0.414

# > Penalty_weights2
# [1] 0.633   0.367

# Note that the penalty weights are not much different from the GORICA weights. This (given that the hypotheses per definition do not accept 
# for their boundary) may indicate that there is support for the boundary of the hypotheses, that is, the hypothesis stating that 
# the cross-lagged effects are the same for each time point.
